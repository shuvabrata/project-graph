"""
Load Git Commits & Files into Neo4j.
This loads Layer 7 of the graph: Commit and File nodes with their relationships.

Key differences from previous layers:
- Two node types: Commit and File
- MODIFIES relationships have properties (additions, deletions)
- Multiple relationship types: PART_OF, AUTHORED_BY, MODIFIES, REFERENCES
- Follows the same pattern: merge nodes one at a time, caller may/may not have relationships
