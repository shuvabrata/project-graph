# Layer 7 Summary: Git Commits & Files

## Generation Statistics

### Nodes Created
- **Commits**: 500
- **Files**: 286
- **Total Nodes**: 786

### Relationships Created
- **PART_OF** (Commit → Branch): 500
- **AUTHORED_BY** (Commit → Person): 500
- **MODIFIES** (Commit → File): 1,088
- **REFERENCES** (Commit → Issue): 400
- **Total Relationships**: 2,488

## Commit Metrics

- **Total Commits**: 500
- **Date Range**: October 11, 2025 - January 16, 2026 (3 months)
- **Jira Reference Rate**: 80% (400 commits reference issues)
  - Story References: 300 (75% of Jira refs)
  - Bug References: 100 (25% of Jira refs)
- **Average Files per Commit**: 2.2
- **Average Lines Added per Commit**: 242
- **Average Lines Deleted per Commit**: Varies per commit
- **Total Files Changed**: 1,088 file modifications across 500 commits

## File Distribution

- **Total Files**: 286 files across 8 repositories
- **Average Files per Repository**: ~36 files
- **File Types**: Production code and test files
- **Languages**: Python, TypeScript, Java, Go, Ruby (based on repository languages)

## Author Distribution

Commits are weighted by seniority:
- **Junior Engineers**: Weight 1 (fewer commits)
- **Mid-Level Engineers**: Weight 3 (moderate commits)
- **Senior Engineers**: Weight 5 (more commits)
- **Staff Engineers**: Weight 7 (most commits)

This reflects realistic contribution patterns where more experienced engineers typically contribute more code.

## Repository Activity

All commits are distributed across 8 repositories:
1. auth-service (Python)
2. user-service (TypeScript)
3. payment-gateway (Java)
4. notification-system (Go)
5. analytics-engine (Python)
6. frontend-app (TypeScript)
7. mobile-app (TypeScript)
8. data-pipeline (Python)

## Temporal Distribution

Commits are distributed across sprint periods with weighted timestamps:
- **Working Hours**: 70% of commits (8 AM - 6 PM)
- **Early Morning**: 10% (6 AM - 8 AM)
- **Evening**: 15% (6 PM - 10 PM)
- **Night**: 5% (10 PM - 6 AM)

## Validation Results

### Load Status
✅ All 500 commits loaded successfully
✅ All 286 files loaded successfully
✅ All 2,488 relationships created successfully
✅ Constraints created on Commit.id, Commit.sha, File.id

### Data Quality Checks
✅ No duplicate commit SHAs
✅ All commits linked to valid branches (default branches only)
✅ All commits linked to valid authors (engineers from Layer 1)
✅ 80% of commits reference valid Jira issues (Layer 4)
✅ All file paths are unique within their repository context
✅ MODIFIES relationships include per-file change statistics

## Key Insights

1. **Jira Integration**: 80% of commits are linked to work items, demonstrating strong traceability
2. **Code Activity**: Average of 2.2 files changed per commit indicates focused, incremental development
3. **Default Branch Focus**: All tracked commits are on default branches, representing production-ready code
4. **Developer Engagement**: All 50 engineers contribute commits, with distribution weighted by seniority
5. **Multi-Repository**: Activity spans all 8 repositories in the system

## Dependencies Met

- ✅ Layer 1: People & Teams (50 engineers available as commit authors)
- ✅ Layer 4: Stories & Bugs (80 issues available for references)
- ✅ Layer 5: Repositories (8 repos with defined languages)
- ✅ Layer 6: Branches (37 branches, 8 default branches identified)

## Next Steps

With Layer 7 complete, the foundation is ready for:
- **Layer 8**: Pull Requests (linking commits to code review processes)
- **Cross-Layer Analytics**: 
  - Team productivity by commit volume
  - Issue resolution velocity (Jira → Commits)
  - Code ownership patterns (Files → Authors)
  - Repository health metrics (commit frequency, churn)
