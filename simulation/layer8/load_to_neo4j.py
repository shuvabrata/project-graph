"""
Load Pull Requests into Neo4j.
This loads Layer 8 of the graph: PullRequest nodes with their relationships.

Key differences from previous layers:
- PullRequest nodes have nullable datetimes (merged_at, closed_at)
- REVIEWED_BY relationships have properties (state: APPROVED/CHANGES_REQUESTED/COMMENTED)
- Multiple relationship types connecting PRs to commits, branches, and people
- Follows the same pattern: merge nodes one at a time, caller may/may not have relationships
